From all the assignments of related to industry talk and visit, I learned the way to filter important information. Design thinking project helps me address real-world challenges effectively, enabling me to participate in
meaningful projects, enhance my practical and communication skills. For improvement,I will attend more industry visits to deepen my knowledge and stay updated on current trends, participating in international competitions to gain practical experience.

This is perhaps the most significant learning that I undertook as part of the course for C++ taken in university. This really took me into the realm of object-oriented programming and also built excellent problem-solving capabilities through the various practical lessons I have gone through. Important things like arrays, file input/output, and even object-oriented basics make a part of these many learned subjects. While I enjoyed understanding how to write and organize code, I found working with arrays and handling input and output files particularly challenging. Coursework involved the creation of programs and debugging complicated codes that challenged my logical thinking and attention to detail. Teamwork projects also prepared me on how to go about teamwork and communicating effectively with others in programming. Fortunately, with the support of my group member Vera Sam, I could complete all my programming assignments. In general, this course improved not only my technical skills but also sparked a more profound interest in advanced topics of computer science. This course gave me a very strong foundation to continue improving my programming skills.
I suggest, in the future, to have more programming projects actually given out, so that we can develop our programming skills.

The course covered various topics, including set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees, and finite automata. Among these, I found recurrence relations and proof techniques particularly challenging. Additionally, understanding deterministic finite automata and modeling finite state machines expanded my perspective on how electronic devices and systems are designed. Since our assignment 1 came out with many careless mistakes, therefore, for the next three assignments, I'd double-check at least three times to make sure that there are no mistakes made by my group members and also myself. For improvement, I hope that the content of the slides given could be more detailed and well-explained. Also, the slides or lecturer should give more questions that are at the same level compared with our test since all the questions given in class and slides are simple and direct questions. In order for me to score this course, self-learning is so important for us to understand deeper about certain subtopics.

This course covered essential topics like numbering systems,logic gates, Boolean algebra, and the design of both combinational and sequential circuits. Through the labs that were conducted during class, it provided me a hands-on chance to do the connection of logic gates and how to use and simulate the circuit using the DEEDS application. I really appreciate that labs are conducted since they are very useful for understanding the topics. Our lecturer also gives a good explanation for all the topics. By the end of the course, I gained the skills to design and implement digital circuits for practical problems, which has significantly enhanced my problem-solving abilities and confidence in working with microprocessor-based systems.

Konklusinya,bagi mencegah kejadian serupa, pihak berkuasa perlulah menguatkuasakan undang-undang dengan lebih ketat seperti memberikan hukuman yang lebih berat kepada sesiapa yang menjalankan aktiviti rasuah.Selain itu, pemantauan yang berterusan terhadap kegiatan kontraktor juga penting dalam membanteras aktiviti rasuah. Di samping itu, kempen kesedaran mengenai kesan buruk rasuah dalam kalangan kontraktor dan pegawai kerajaan juga harus diadakan.
